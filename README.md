My final project for a scientific computing class during my undergrad. The Hodgkin-Huxley equation won a nobel prize in physiology for describing how action potentials are intitiated and propogated in neurons. 
Being a project for a math/science class I couldn't just use an existing package to solve the differential equations, additionally we wanted a mathematically simple and computationally efficient way to solve these equations.
For simplicities sake we chose the use Eulers method of approximation.
